    This inference script is intended to be used within a Docker container as part of the KiTS Test set submission. It
    expects to find input files (.nii.gz) in /input and will write the segmentation output to /output
    
    For testing purposes we set the paths to something local, but once we pack it in a docker we need to adapt them of 
    course
    
    IMPORTANT: This script performs inference using one nnU-net configuration (3d_lowres, 3d_fullres, 2d OR 
    3d_cascade_fullres). Within the /parameter folder, nnU-Net expects to find fold_X subfolders where X is the fold ID 
    (typically [0-4]). These folds CANNOT originate from different configurations. There also needs to be the plans.pkl 
    file that you find along with these fold_X folders in the 
    corresponding nnunet training output directory.

    Note: nnU-Net will read the correct nnU-Net trainer class from the plans.pkl file. Thus there is no need to 
    specify it here.
